# Track C — Agentic Systems Engineering

## Track Objective

Teach students how to design **controlled, observable, and economically viable agent systems**.

This track rejects:
- Unbounded autonomy
- Tool sprawl
- Magical thinking

---

## Modules in This Track

- C1. Agent Boundaries & Control
- C2. Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns
- C3. Agent Observability & Telemetry

---

## Design Doctrine

Agents must:
- Know when to stop
- Know when to ask for help
- Leave an audit trail
- Be cheaper than the humans they assist

---

## Common Student Mistakes

- Too many agents
- No explicit constraints
- No failure telemetry

These are intentionally surfaced during labs.
