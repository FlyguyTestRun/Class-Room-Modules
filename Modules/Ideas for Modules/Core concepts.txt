## Learning Outcomes & Assessment Rubrics

### Global Learning Outcomes
By certification completion, learners will be able to:
- Design agentic systems with explicit autonomy boundaries
- Select appropriate models and tools based on cost and context
- Build, test, and evaluate agents in controlled environments
- Explain failure modes and mitigation strategies
- Deploy agents using both proprietary and open-source models

### Assessment Rubric (Applied Across Modules)

| Dimension | Exemplary | Proficient | Developing | Insufficient |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| Conceptual Understanding | Clear mental models, correct distinctions | Mostly accurate | Partial understanding | Confused definitions |
| System Design | Modular, resilient, scalable | Functional design | Fragile design | Ad-hoc |
| Cost Awareness | Explicit budgeting & controls | Reasonable estimates | Minimal awareness | No consideration |
| Safety & Governance | Guardrails + monitoring | Guardrails only | Ad-hoc safety | Unsafe |
| Implementation | Clean, documented, reproducible | Working | Partially working | Non-functional |
