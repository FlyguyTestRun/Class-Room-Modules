# Personal Projects


Curriculum Progression (Optional Framing)

Students begin with relational databases and ORMs, introduce vector storage for semantic search, and progress toward multi-database architectures supporting agent memory, retrieval, and production-scale AI systems.

## Module on API & Integration Technologies

 - **Azure API Management (APIM)**: Fully managed in Azure; import OpenAPI specs in one click; *built-in developer portal*; policies (rate limit, JWT via Azure AD); analytics.
 **Deploy FastAPI/.NET/Node.js** API → *front with APIM → share polished portal URL.*

 - **AWS API Gateway**: Serverless, integrates deeply with Lambda, Cognito, Bedrock (for AI APIs).  Serverless API with Lambda + API Gateway; add usage plans & API keys.

 - **NGINX / NGINX Plus**: High-performance reverse proxy + basic API gateway features (with modules). **Portfolio win**: Simple, fast gateway in Docker; great for learning traffic management.

- **AsyncAPI**: Specification for event-driven APIs (like Kafka, RabbitMQ). ****Emerging standard for message-based systems.** Add a small Kafka/FastAPI project with AsyncAPI docs — stands out in AI/ML portfolios.

- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs that lets clients request exactly the data they need. Flexible API endpoint instead of many REST routes. Example for class module "GraphQL backend with Apollo Server + React frontend". Modern and in high demand (replacing REST in many companies).
 
- Any API (FastAPI, ASP.NET Core Minimal API) → OpenAPI spec → Azure APIM import → share developer portal with auth & rate limiting. Open-source showcase: Kong or Tyk self-hosted in Docker → document plugins & observability. Multi-cloud bonus: Kong (supports Azure/AWS/GCP). Zero/low cost: All have generous free tiers; pair with Postman collections for testing.
  These additions emphasize production-grade API exposure, security, and discoverability — exactly what stands out in technical portfolios and enterprise interviews.

# Updated Module Tools W/ Argo Workflows & BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift (AWS)
  ## Containerization & Orchestration

- **Docker**: Containerization "build once, run anywhere" for ML environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration, managing clusters of containers for distributed inference.
- **Helm**: Package manager for K8s charts, simplifying deployment of complex AI stacks.

*Added*: Argo Workflows (for ML pipelines; event-driven orchestration).


## Databases & Data Access

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational DB with pgvector for vectors, ideal for hybrid structured/unstructured AI data.
- **Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)**: Abstracts database interactions for AI code.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Python ORM for ML datasets, simplifying queries in data pipelines.

*Added*: BigQuery (GCP analytics), Snowflake (cloud warehouse), Redshift (AWS)—for petabyte-scale AI data processing.

## Distributed Systems & Messaging

- **Distributed Systems**: For scalable AI, handling failures and coordination.
- **Message Queues**: Event-driven AI, decoupling components.
- **RabbitMQ**: Reliable messaging for async AI tasks, like queuing inference requests.
- **Caching Layers**: Speed up AI inference by storing frequent results.
- **Redis**: In-memory store with vector support, for real-time AI caching.

*Added*: Kafka (for streaming AI data; high-throughput events).


# Scripting, Automation & Infrastructure Engineering
🔹 Automates AI workflows.

- **PowerShell**: Windows automation for AI scripts, e.g., deploying models.
- **Automation Platforms**: For orchestrating AI processes.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**: Tools like Terraform/Ansible for provisioning AI infra declaratively.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions for automated ML deployments.

*Added*: Airflow, Prefect, Dagster—for scheduling and monitoring ML pipelines.
