# CoreSkills4AI

## Purpose

CoreSkills4AI is a capability-driven curriculum for designing, deploying, and governing real-world AI systems.
This repository prioritizes **decision-making, failure analysis, cost realism, and agentic control** over tool memorization.

This is not a framework showcase.
This is an AI systems engineering program.
