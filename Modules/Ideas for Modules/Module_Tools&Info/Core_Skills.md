# CoreSkills4AI — Master Curriculum Architecture

## Design Philosophy

CoreSkills4AI is structured around **capability acquisition**, not tool exposure.
Every module answers a single question:

> "What decision should a competent AI practitioner be able to make at this stage?"

The curriculum progresses from **mental models → system design → agentic control → economic and governance realism**.

## Capability Ladders Overview

### Track A — AI System Thinking (Foundational)
Applies to all roles: engineers, architects, leaders, and operators.

- A1. AI Systems Mental Models
- A2. AI Failure Modes & Anti-Patterns
- A3. Token Economics & Context Physics

---

### Track B — Data & Context Engineering
Focuses on *why* models succeed or fail before introducing agents.

- B1. Context Is the Product
- B2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems
- B3. Structured + Unstructured Hybrid Retrieval

---

### Track C — Agentic Systems Engineering
The CoreSkills4AI signature track.

- C1. Agent Boundaries & Control Design
- C2. Multi-Agent Architecture Patterns
- C3. Agent Observability & Economic Telemetry

---

### Track D — Deployment, Cost & Governance Reality
Bridges classroom systems to production constraints.

- D1. AI Cost Engineering
- D2. Governance-by-Design
- D3. AI Systems in Hostile & Adversarial Environments

---

### Track E — Human & Organizational Integration
Often missing from technical programs.

- E1. Human Trust & AI UX Design
- E2. When NOT to Use AI
- E3. Legacy System AI Integration
