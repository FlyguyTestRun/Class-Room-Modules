## Role of the Instructor

You are not teaching tools.
You are teaching **engineering judgment**.

Students should leave able to:
- Explain trade-offs
- Defend constraints
- Diagnose failures
- Estimate cost and risk

---

## Teaching Model

Each module follows a consistent flow:

1. Conceptual framing
2. Failure case analysis
3. Guided lab
4. Reflection & justification

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not rush into coding
- Do not optimize for novelty
- Do not allow unchecked automation

---

## Assessment Philosophy

- Written explanations matter as much as working code
- Partial solutions with strong reasoning score highly
- Over-engineering is penalized

---

## Delivery Modes

- Instructor-led cohort
- Self-paced professional study
- Enterprise internal training

---
