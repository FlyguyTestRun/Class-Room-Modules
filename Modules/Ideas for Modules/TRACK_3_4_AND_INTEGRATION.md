## PORTFOLIO SHOWCASE STRATEGY

Your real client work should appear as **case studies** embedded throughout:

| Track/Module | Your Case Study |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Track 1, M1 | "Why AI Mattered: Client ROI Impact" |
| Track 2, M4 | "Building RAG for [Client]'s Knowledge Base" |
| Track 2, M7 | "Deploying Production RAG (Cost Optimization)" |
| Track 3, M2 | "Data Architecture for [Client]'s AI" |
| Track 3, M9 | "Enterprise System Design Case Study" |
| Track 4, M7 | "Full Consulting Engagement" |

**For Each Case Study:**
- **Problem:** What challenge did client face?
- **Solution:** Your technical approach
- **Results:** Metrics (cost saved, accuracy, speed, ROI)
- **Lessons:** What you learned, what you'd do differently
- **Code/Artifacts:** Sanitized versions (no client data)

**Privacy Note:** Anonymize client names, use generic company descriptions.
