# Module ID — Module Title

## Module Purpose (Learning Contract)

This module exists to teach **one specific capability**.
Students should leave able to make **one new class of decision** they could not reliably make before.

This is not a tool tutorial.
This is a systems reasoning module.

---

## Target Audience

- Primary: [e.g., AI Engineers, Architects, Leaders]
- Secondary: [Optional]

---

## Prerequisites

Students must already understand:
- [Concept or prior module]
- [Concept or prior module]

---

## Learning Outcomes (Non-Negotiable)

By the end of this module, students can:

1. Explain ______________________________
2. Diagnose _____________________________
3. Justify _______________________________

If a student cannot *explain and defend* these outcomes, the module is not complete.

---

## Core Concepts

This module introduces and reinforces:

- Concept 1 — short, precise description
- Concept 2 — short, precise description
- Concept 3 — short, precise description

Avoid tool-specific explanations unless required to demonstrate the concept.

---

## What This Module Is NOT

This module does NOT attempt to:
- Cover every tool
- Optimize for novelty
- Teach implementation tricks without rationale

---

## Canonical Mental Models

Students should internalize:

- Model A → when it applies
- Model B → when it fails
- Trade-off C → why it matters

These mental models will be reused in later tracks.

---

## Failure Modes Covered

This module intentionally exposes students to:

- Failure Mode 1
- Failure Mode 2
- Failure Mode 3

Students should be able to recognize these without changing models.

---

## Hands-On Lab

### Lab Objective
Students will _______________________________

### Constraints
- Constraint 1 (cost, time, tools, tokens)
- Constraint 2

### Deliverables
- Artifact 1 (diagram, code, report)
- Artifact 2 (written justification)

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Students are evaluated on:

| Dimension | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Reasoning | Can explain *why* decisions were made |
| Trade-offs | Demonstrates awareness of alternatives |
| Constraints | Respects imposed limits |
| Clarity | Clear, defensible explanations |

Working code alone is insufficient.

---

## Reflection Questions (Required)

Students must answer:

1. What decision was hardest to make and why?
2. What would break first at scale?
3. What would you change with double the budget?

---

## Forward Linkage

This module directly enables:
- [Next module]
- [Future capstone]

Failure to understand this module will cause downstream failure.

---

## Instructor Notes (Hidden from Learners)

- Common student misconceptions:
  - Misconception 1
  - Misconception 2
- Where to slow down
- Where *not* to rescue students
