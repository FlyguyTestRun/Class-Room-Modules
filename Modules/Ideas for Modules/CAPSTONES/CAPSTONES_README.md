# CoreSkills4AI Capstones

## Purpose

Capstones validate **integrated system thinking**, not isolated skills.

Each capstone:
- Introduces real-world constraints
- Requires justification documents
- Is graded on reasoning as much as execution

---

## Capstone Progression

### Capstone 1 — Controlled RAG System
Focus: Context, retrieval, cost

### Capstone 2 — Cost-Constrained Agent System
Focus: Boundaries, observability, failure modes

### Capstone 3 — Governed Enterprise Workflow
Focus: Governance, risk, auditability

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- Architectural clarity
- Trade-off justification
- Cost awareness
- Failure handling

---

## Final Note

If a system “works” but cannot be explained, it does not pass.
