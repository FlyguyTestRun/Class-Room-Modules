System Architecture (End-to-End)
A. Client Layer (Mobile App)

iOS / Android

Journal input UI

Chat-style reflection interface

Authentication (email, Apple, Google)

Stripe/RevenueCat SDK for subscriptions

Feature flags tied to subscription status

Critical observation

Free-tier journal entries appear not persisted (or persisted only temporarily)

Paid tier unlocks durable memory

This strongly implies server-side storage is gated, not the journaling UI itself.

B. API / Application Layer

Typical stack

Node.js (NestJS / Express) or Python (FastAPI)



Stateless endpoints for:

/journal/submit

/chat/respond

/memory/retrieve

/billing/status

Free-tier behavior

Journal entry is:

Passed to LLM for immediate reflection

Possibly cached in Redis for session continuity

Not written to long-term storage

Once session ends, data is discarded

Paid-tier behavior

Journal entry is:

Written to relational DB

Embedded

Stored in vector DB

Associated with user ID and timestamps
